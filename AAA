🔐 AAA in Cybersecurity: Beginner to Advanced
What is AAA?
AAA stands for:

Authentication – Who are you?

Authorization – What can you do?

Accounting – What did you do?

These three concepts are the backbone of secure access control.

🧠 Beginner Level
1. Authentication (Who are you?)
Verifying the identity of a user, device, or system.

Common methods: username + password, biometrics, MFA (multi-factor authentication).

Example: You log in to Gmail with your email and password.

2. Authorization (What can you do?)
Determines what authenticated users are allowed to do.

It checks permissions based on roles or policies.

Example: A teacher can access student grades, but a student cannot access all class records.

3. Accounting (What did you do?)
Tracks user activities: login times, file access, commands run, etc.

Useful for audit trails and forensic investigations.

Example: Logging when a user downloads a confidential file or deletes data.

🧠 Intermediate Level
AAA in Practice:
AAA systems enforce least privilege—only give users what they need.

They’re implemented using protocols like:

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)

TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus)

AAA Example Stack:

Authentication → MFA via Okta

Authorization → AWS IAM policies

Accounting → CloudTrail, Syslog, Splunk

🧠 Advanced Level
How AAA fits into a Zero Trust Architecture:
Never trust, always verify.

Every user/device must authenticate each time.

Dynamic authorization based on risk/context.

All actions are logged and reviewed (accounting).

Integration with Identity Providers:
SSO (Single Sign-On) via Azure AD or Okta.

Federation with SAML, OAuth, or OpenID Connect.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).

🌐 Real-World Examples in AWS, Azure, and Splunk
🟡 AWS (Amazon Web Services)

AAA Component	AWS Service / Feature	Real-World Example
Authentication	IAM Users, MFA, SSO	A developer logs in using IAM credentials with MFA.
Authorization	IAM Policies, Roles	A Lambda function can only read from S3, not write.
Accounting	CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs	Track all actions: who accessed EC2, when, and from where.
Scenario: You restrict EC2 termination rights only to DevOps Leads and log all changes using CloudTrail, storing them in an S3 bucket for Splunk ingestion.

🔵 Azure

AAA Component	Azure Feature	Real-World Example
Authentication	Azure Active Directory (AAD)	A user logs in using AAD + Conditional Access Policy (MFA if outside company network).
Authorization	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)	A support engineer can view VMs but cannot delete them.
Accounting	Azure Monitor, Azure Activity Logs	Logs who created/deleted VMs or changed network settings.
Scenario: A company uses Azure AD for SSO. Users must pass MFA to access sensitive apps, and their activities are logged in Azure Monitor and sent to Sentinel (SIEM).

🟢 Splunk

AAA Component	Splunk Feature	Real-World Example
Authentication	LDAP, SAML, Okta integration	A user logs in using corporate Okta credentials.
Authorization	Splunk roles	Analysts can view logs, Admins can configure inputs and outputs.
Accounting	Audit logs	Track who searched for what data, who created alerts, who edited dashboards.
Scenario: You create Splunk roles:

Analyst: read-only access to logs.

SOC Lead: can modify dashboards and schedule alerts.

All actions are logged in splunkd.log and searchable with index=_audit.

🧰 BONUS: Commands/Queries to Try
AWS – Audit IAM usage:
bash
Copy
Edit
aws iam get-account-authorization-details
Azure – View login activity:
bash
Copy
Edit
az monitor activity-log list --resource-group "MyGroup"
Splunk – Audit search logs:
spl
Copy
Edit
index=_audit action=search info=completed user=*

AAA	Question	Function
Authentication	Who are you?	Identity verification
Authorization	What can you do?	Access control
Accounting	What did you do?	Logging & auditing

Great! Let’s dive into hands-on mini-projects for AWS, Azure, and Splunk to help you practice AAA in a real-world setup.

🛠️ AAA Mini-Projects (AWS, Azure, Splunk)
✅ AWS AAA Mini Project: Secure EC2 Access with Logs
🧩 Objective: Set up secure login (Authentication), apply least-privilege (Authorization), and track access (Accounting).

🔑 Step 1: Authentication
Create an IAM User (e.g., dev-ec2-user)

Attach MFA using AWS CLI or Console

Enable AWS SSO (optional for larger orgs)

bash
Copy
Edit
aws iam create-user --user-name dev-ec2-user
aws iam create-login-profile --user-name dev-ec2-user --password 'TempPass123!'
🔐 Step 2: Authorization
Create an IAM Role or Policy to allow only EC2 read access

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Attach the policy to dev-ec2-user

📜 Step 3: Accounting
Enable CloudTrail

Set up a trail to log all actions to S3

bash
Copy
Edit
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name MyTrail --s3-bucket-name my-cloudtrail-bucket
aws cloudtrail start-logging --name MyTrail
Optional: Forward CloudTrail logs to Splunk

✅ Azure AAA Mini Project: Controlled App Access
🧩 Objective: Use Azure AD for auth, RBAC for access control, and log all user activities.

🔑 Step 1: Authentication
Create a user in Azure AD (e.g., appadmin@yourdomain.com)

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication

Set up Conditional Access Policy

🔐 Step 2: Authorization
Assign RBAC role:

E.g., Contributor (can manage resources) or Reader (view only)

bash
Copy
Edit
az role assignment create \
  --assignee appadmin@yourdomain.com \
  --role "Reader" \
  --scope /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}
📜 Step 3: Accounting
Go to Azure Monitor → Activity Log

Set up a Log Analytics workspace

Query logs with Kusto Query Language (KQL)

kusto
Copy
Edit
AuditLogs 
| where ActivityDisplayName == "Sign-in"
| summarize count() by UserPrincipalName
✅ Splunk AAA Mini Project: Secure Role-Based Dashboard Access
🧩 Objective: Set up users, control dashboard visibility, and track usage.

🔑 Step 1: Authentication
Integrate LDAP or SAML

Or create local users via Splunk UI:
Settings → Access Controls → Users

🔐 Step 2: Authorization
Create custom roles:

read_only_analyst: can view only dashboards

soc_admin: can edit alerts and inputs

Settings → Access Controls → Roles → New Role

📜 Step 3: Accounting
Monitor user activity with this SPL query:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=_audit action=* user=*
| stats count by user action info
Create an alert if unauthorized changes are made to critical dashboards.

🚀 Bonus Challenges (Optional)
🔐 AWS: Use IAM Access Analyzer to find overly permissive roles.

🔐 Azure: Create an alert if a user logs in from an unusual location.

🔐 Splunk: Generate a report of users who searched sensitive indexes in the last 30 days.
